### 1. Explanation

This project provides a Proof of Concept for representing SEND conformance checks using Shapes Constraint Language (SHACL). SEND data is converted to Linked Data as Resource Description Format (RDF) and SHACL is used to create validation reports for the data. The goal is to increase efficiency by decreasing labor-intensive checks by both the sponsor and regulatory agencies. 

### 2. Data Conversion, Modeling, Mapping

Data conversion from source XPT files to graph.

### 3. SHACL 

#### [3.1 SHACL Introduction and Resources](SHACL-Intro.md)
Resources for learning SHACL

#### [3.2 Modeling an Example SEND Rule using SHACL](SHACL-SENDRuleEg.md)
An example of how a SEND Rule is modeled on a simple dataset using SHACL. The data is for illustrative purposes only and does not have the same schema as the project data.

#### 3.3 SHACL for Project Data
Example models and documentation for the SHACL rules applied to the data schema used in this project.
