Project Documentation
=====================

# Table of Contents

## 1. Data Conversion, Modeling, Mapping

SEND data is converted to Linked Data as Resource Description Format (RDF) using an ontology-based schema.

* [1.1 SEND Mapping and conversion](DataConversion.md)  SAS XPT to RDF.

## 2. SHACL for Project Data

FDA Validation Rules are translated to SHACL to create validation reports. 

### [2.1 SEND Rule DM SD1002 in SHACL](SHACL-SENDRule102Details.md)

#### [2.2 How to run Validation Reports](SHACL-ApplyToData.md)


## References and Resources

* Project structure and methods including project data files, scripts, coding conventions, and data modeling decisions.

### [Project Repository Structure](Repository-Ref.md)

* Details of the GitHub repository structure and content.

### [Regulatory](Regulatory-Ref.md)

* Regulatory Reference Documentation (Conformance rules, documentation).

### [SHACL Introduction and Resources](SHACL-Intro.md)

* Resources for learning SHACL

### [Modeling an Example SEND Rule using SHACL](SHACL-SENDRuleEg.md)
An example of how a SEND Rule is modeled in SHACL for a simple dataset. The source row-by-column data structure is converted to RDF without following an ontology-based schema and is for illustrative purposes only. The resulting graph data does not follow the approach used in this project.

### [Ontology](Ontology-Ref.md)

* Ontology details.  *To be added*


## How-To Guides

* Step-by-step guides to working with the data.  ***TO BE DEVELOPED***
