## Introduction

Study data submitted to the FDA must meet structure and completeness standards detailed in the **FDA Standards Catalog** <font class='toBeAdded>Add Ref</font> as a first step in the submission process, and the FDA may reject an application based solely on technical deficiencies. The "Technical Rejection Criteria for Study Data (TRC)" detail a number of requirements of varying severity. [Chen and Hussong (2019)](FDA/PhUSEUSConnect2019-SA15.pdf) reported a recent analysis of 2016-2018 data showed approximately 32% of submissions contained critical errors.  

The submission rules are not complex, but there can be confusion surrounding their implementation. To FDA recently created a [Self-Check Worksheet for Study Data Preparation](FDA/TRC Self-Check Worksheet_01222019.pdf) and accompanying [Instrudtions](FDA/TRC Worksheet Instructions_01222019.pdf) to assist applicants in preparing their submissions.

## Project Rationale

The submission process can be greatly streamlined by automating the technical submission requirements when the process and data are based on Linked Data principles. Data quality will be increased. Rejection of submissions due to technical issues can be avoided when both sponsors and regulatory agencies employ the same, automated, evaluation processes.
